rdmd can now be used as a shell in makefiles

With gnu make(3.82 or higher), rdmd can now be used in makefiles.
This is accomplished by setting the SHELL and .SHELLFLAGS to /usr/bin/rdmd and --eval respectively.

.ONESHELL:
SHELL = /usr/bin/rdmd
.SHELLFLAGS = --eval
hello.txt:
$(TAB)import std.file;
$(TAB)write("$@","hello world\n");
